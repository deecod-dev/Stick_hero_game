## Game Summary
In this project, we have developed a game called "Stick Hero." The game features a character who traverses between platforms by stretching out a stick. The objective is to reach the goal while collecting rewards (cherries) and avoiding falling into the abyss.

## Game Mechanics
- **Stick Extension:** Players can control the stick-hero to move between platforms by extending a stick.
- **Multiple Pillars:** The game includes multiple pillars of different widths, creating challenges for the player.
- **Testing:** Did testing too of some classes.
- **Designer patterns:** Added two designer patterns in Stick class, Facade and Singleton. 
- **Timing is Key:** Players need to time the stick extension correctly to land on the next platform. Failure results in the character falling and ending the game.
- **Reward Collection:** The character can collect rewards (cherries) by flipping upside down while traversing platforms. Rewards contribute to the player's score.
- **Scoring System:** The game has a scoring system encouraging players to achieve higher scores by collecting more rewards.
- **Sounds:** To make the game interactive, sounds have been added.


-**BONUS**
- **Difficulty:** Increasing the speed of the stick elongation till a certain point to make the game challenging.
- **Backgrounds:** Randomizing around with 5 different background with 1 night mode.
- **Timer Feature(Multithreading):** Added a timer and use multithreading in it.
- **Saving Feature:** Players can save the game at a moment using pause and load it from that point in time.
## Code Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the Stick Hero game from the command line (cmd), follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Open the command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
4. Compile the code using the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn clean compile package
   ```
   
Note: jar may not work
Note: If it shows any issue in running the jar file, it is probably due to some code not added in pom.xml, otherwise the code can be run using the default play button on intellijIdea too.
Ensure that you have the necessary JavaFX libraries and dependencies configured to run the game successfully.

Note: Modify the paths in the code that reference external assets (images, sounds) to match your file system.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or have questions about the Stick Hero game. Enjoy playing!
